wireshark
3 way handshake
packet analysis


wireshark
start capture
open firefox
https website
go to wireshark
click stop

filter the traffic
find the ip address
ip.addr == ip address
filter the traffi

hashing = fixed length hash
hash = 1 way
encryption = 2 way
integrity check = check for alteration

hash calc = share hash value to the receiver to check for changes
hashing is irreversible
can save in database too. but encryption = no.

registry is for control, not for storage

c
windows
system32
config
sam

cant read the sam file. cant while on. will need to read the hard disk. retrieve the sam.

Linux = shadow file
/etc/shadow

salting = adding random values in between the hash values to make it un crackable


etc/passwd
/bin/zsh
cat /etc/passwd | grep /bin/zsh

logs of your web server stored in kali


cd /var/log
ls
cd apache2
ls

to search in a folder
grep -r folder

sudo grep -r "19.168.145.144"
check the acces logs of the yesterday server
concentrate on one ip address
 cat ssh.log
grep -r parrot
pipe symbol

dig a log to find an incident
incident = something that affects CIA
do full analysis
find root cause

change the password

virtualbox > workstation
system completly compromised = intrusion
event = alerts = observable occurence
intrusion   incident    event = know the difference

affect CIA = incident.
/var/log = logs in linux
in windows = event manager or event viewer
SIEM tools to manage Event Viewer to see logs in windows

DLP tool to make sure the analyser  = prevents unauthorized copy.
cant copy, cant mail the logs
no copy, no delete, no alter. all in logs. will be analyzed.
wrong alert = FP.
alert came, no attack.
TP = attack happened, alert happened.
TP FP TN FN = confusing.
FP vs TP =
TN = attack happened, no alert came,
SIEM not properly configured.
FN = mostly dont happen.


brute force attack= use all permutations and combinations to find password.
4 digit pin = try all possible combo. = 10000 possibilities.
lowercase, 5 digit bruteforce attack = 1 crore...
10 digit = 141 trillion possibilities in lower case alone. 12 to 13 days to crack.

GPU
CPU vs GPU. why do we need?
for fasting math calculations.
graphics card = 10 times faster than CPU.
GPU based machine.
Crackers/ miners
spend 5 lakhs for a system. for gpu.
pay them in bitcoins. you give hash, they get password. you pay 1000.

5 char = 11 minutes with GPU.
Password cracking in kali = CPU over heat, cpu fails.
100 degree = cpu burns.
change motherboard itself.

brute force complications.

digits, symbols, upper case, lower case = buteforce takes a lifetime.
passphrase = infinity war.

dictionary attack = efficient than brute force
password list famous one = rockyou.txt
137mb file in github
1.6 crore passwrd there. find yours.
most common use passwords

birthday attack
collect info from social media, create own word list

CRUNCH tool available in github. create own wordlist

use rockyou to find a hash and try to crack it.
MD5 hashing algorithm.

text to md file. a tool.
---md5sum anyword

| to combine
echo sainsta | md5sum

hashcat = gpu based tool
hydra = online password cracking tool
jhontheripper = cpu based tool


echo saish | md5sum > sfile.txt
ls
cat sfile.txt
